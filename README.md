# CO Group Project
> Final project for CSE112 (Computer Organisation), made by Akshit Gupta, Arhaan Bahadur, Ishir Bhardwaj, and Manit Kaushik.

## Overview

We designed and implemented a custom assembler and simulator for a given ISA in Python 3. The project is divided into four main parts:

1. **Assembler**: Converts assembly code to machine code.
2. **Simulator**: Executes the machine code.
3. **Floating-Point Extension**: Adds support for simple floating-point computations.
4. **Bonus**: Extends the assembler and simulator with five new instructions.

## Collaboration

The work was evenly divided among all team members, ensuring fair contribution and collaboration.
